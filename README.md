Built for Base x Farcaster Singapore Hackathon!

Castaways - Singaporean Litmus Test

- Castaways is a personality quiz frame that is catered specifically to the Singaporean Context. 
The questions and answers target situations unique to locals and at the end of it, produce a resulting personality type.

- The frame is built on the Frog (frog.fm) framework, with NextJS template and deployed on Vercel.
